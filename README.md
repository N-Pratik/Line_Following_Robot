## What is a Line Following Bot?
A line following robot(referred as LFR from here) is a type of mobile robot that is designed to follow a predetermined path, typically a line or a series of lines, using sensors to detect the line's position and adjust its movement accordingly. The robot typically uses infrared or optical sensors to detect the line and then uses that information to control its movement, either by adjusting the speed or direction of its wheels or by adjusting the position of its body. The goal of a line following robot is to follow the line as accurately and efficiently as possible, without deviating from the path or getting stuck. They are widely used in various industries like material handling and manufacturing, as well as in research and educational settings.

> In this guide we will be discussing about LFR that uses IR sensors and Differential Drive mechanism for mobolity.
